# Request Sender Nylas

**Request Sender Nylas is a TypeScript library that provides an implementation of the `RequestSenderInterface` specifically for interacting with the Nylas API.** This library builds on the foundation provided by `Request Sender Core`, making it easy to send authenticated requests to the Nylas API using a consistent interface.

## Installation

Install the package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @dmitryrechkin/request-sender-nylas
```

## Features

- **Nylas-Specific Implementation**: Extends the `HttpRequestSender` class to add authentication headers and handle Nylas-specific API requirements.
- **Factory Pattern Support**: Easily create instances of `NylasRequestSender` using the factory pattern, enabling dynamic instantiation based on your applicationâ€™s needs.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrate with the Nylas API by providing API key, grant ID, and other required authentication details.

## Usage

### Sending a Request to the Nylas API

```typescript
import { NylasRequestSender } from '@dmitryrechkin/request-sender-nylas';
import { TypeNylasAuthentication } from './Type/NylasAuthentication';

const auth: TypeNylasAuthentication = {
    apiKey: 'your-nylas-api-key',
    apiUrl: 'https://api.nylas.com',
    grantId: 'your-grant-id'
};

const nylasSender = new NylasRequestSender(auth);
const response = await nylasSender.send('/events', {
    method: 'GET'
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log('Nylas API response data:', data);
```

### Using the Nylas Request Sender Factory

The factory pattern allows you to create instances of `NylasRequestSender` dynamically, which can be useful for dependency injection or when you need multiple senders with different configurations.

#### Creating a Factory

```typescript
import { NylasRequestSenderFactory } from '@dmitryrechkin/request-sender-nylas';
import { TypeNylasAuthentication } from './Type/NylasAuthentication';

const factory = new NylasRequestSenderFactory();

const auth: TypeNylasAuthentication = {
    apiKey: 'your-nylas-api-key',
    apiUrl: 'https://api.nylas.com',
    grantId: 'your-grant-id'
};

const nylasSender = factory.create(auth); // Create a new NylasRequestSender instance

const response = await nylasSender.send('/events', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});

console.log('Response status:', response.status);
```

## When to Use

`Request Sender Nylas` is ideal for projects that integrate with the Nylas API, particularly when you need to:

- **Standardize Request Handling**: Use the same interface for sending requests to Nylas as you do with other services, making your codebase more consistent.
- **Simplify API Integration**: Reduce boilerplate code by using a pre-built implementation that handles authentication and other Nylas-specific requirements.
- **Enable Dynamic Request Sending**: Leverage the factory pattern to create request senders on the fly, tailored to different authentication or configuration settings.

## Installation & Setup

Install the package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @dmitryrechkin/request-sender-nylas
```

Ensure your project is set up to handle TypeScript and supports ES modules, as this library is built with modern JavaScript standards.

## Rationale

### Specialized for Nylas API Integration

The `Request Sender Nylas` library extends the `Request Sender Core` to provide a specialized implementation for the Nylas API. By building on top of a unified interface, this library ensures that you can easily integrate Nylas-specific functionality while maintaining consistency across your codebase.

- **Simplified API Calls**: By abstracting the Nylas-specific logic, you can focus on your application's business logic without worrying about the details of API integration.
- **Extensible Design**: The use of the factory pattern allows for dynamic creation of request sender instances, making your application more modular and adaptable to different environments.
